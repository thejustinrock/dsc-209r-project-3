# Healthcare Spending and Life Expectancy

**DSC 209R Project 3 | Worldwide Health Team**

How does the relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy vary across countries and over time?

This interactive D3.js visualization uses World Bank data from 2000 to 2018. Each dot represents a country or territory. The horizontal axis shows healthcare spending per person on a logarithmic scale, and the vertical axis shows life expectancy at birth in years. Colors identify World Bank regions.

## Explore the chart

- **Change the year** with the slider to see how the distribution shifts.
- **Compare two years** side by side on identical axes. Both panels use the same countries and territories with complete data in the selected years.
- **Inspect or pin a country.** Hover over a dot to see its values. Click a dot or use the country menu to trace its path through the selected year.

## What we found

Across the 172 countries and territories with data in both 2000 and 2018, the correlation between log healthcare spending per person and life expectancy rose from **0.80 to 0.84**. Countries that spent more generally had longer life expectancy, but there were clear exceptions. In 2018, Japan spent about **$4,504 per person** and had a life expectancy of **84.2 years**. The United States spent about **$10,624 per person** and had a life expectancy of **78.6 years**.

## Data and methods

The chart uses the [September 2021 World Development Indicators snapshot](https://github.com/light-and-salt/World-Bank-Data-by-Indicators/blob/master/health/health-raw-2021.csv) and [World Bank country metadata](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country?format=json&per_page=400). World Bank aggregates are excluded, along with records missing either measure or reporting zero or negative spending.

- **Healthcare spending** is current health expenditure per person in purchasing-power-adjusted international dollars (current PPP). Changes over time can reflect price changes.
- **Life expectancy** is life expectancy at birth in years.
- **Pearson’s correlation** is calculated between log spending and life expectancy for the countries shown. It measures association and cannot establish the effect of spending on life expectancy.
